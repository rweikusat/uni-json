Universal Json
==============

JSON is a nice, well-defined data format and it's a real shame that
libraries handling it are so hideously complicated. Further, they (at
least the C libraries I looked at) all suffer from the same design
flaws, namely,

	- they implement some scheme for memory management despite
          they shouldn't

	- they define some sort of data representation for their
          output despite they shouldn't

This is meant to become a small library for parsing JSON text and
formatting some complex object as JSON text with a C core which
delegates anything which requires memory allocation and/ or a data
representation to "someone else" and which can thus be used together
with any other programming language which can interoperate with
compiled C code.

I'm planning to create language bindings for Perl and Python and
possibly, C++ in this order.

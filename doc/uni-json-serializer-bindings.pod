=head1 DESCRIPTION

Structure containing pointers to the functions which need to be provided to the uni-json
serializer to use it in a particular runtime environment.

=head2 Binding Functions

=head3 General

=over

=item * C<void output(uint8_t *data, size_t len, void *sink)>

Will be called by the serializer to output a JSON text fragment of C<len> bytes
starting at C<data>. The third argumment will be the C<sink> pointer provided
to C<uni_json_serialize>.

=item * C<int type_of(void *p)>

Called to determine the JSON type to be used for serializing the value pointed to
by C<p>. Must return one of the C<UJ_T...> constants. The effect of returning C<UJ_T_UNK>
(for I<unknown>) is identical to returning C<UJ_T_NULL>.

B<The return value is used to determine the type-specific serializer function to
use for C<p> and it's validity is not checked. Returning a value outside of
C<UJ_T_NULL> - C<UJ_T_UNK> will likely cause a crash or other memory corruption.>

=item * C<void *alloc(size_t len)>

Allocate a memory area of size C<len> for use by the serializer. This is only
used for I<deterministc> or I<pretty-printed> (see L<uni-json-serializer(3)>) output
of objects. Only one such area will be needed at any given time. C<dealloc> will
be called with the returned pointer as argument before C<alloc> will be called
for another time.

=item * C<void dealloc(void *p)>

Called by the serializer to communicate that the memory area pointed to by
C<p> won't be used anymore. The argument will be a pointer returned by an earlier
C<alloc> call.

=back

=head3 Object Serialization

=over

=item * C<void *start_object_traversal(void *obj)>

Called by the serializer to communicate that it wants to serialize
the object C<obj> next. The return value should be some kind of iterator
for this object. The argument will be a pointer a priori call to
C<type_of> return a value of C<UJ_T_BJ> for. The iterator must remain
valid until passed to C<end_object_traversal> regardless of any
calls to other binding routines in between.

=item * C<size_t max_kv_pairs(void *obj)>

Called to determine an upper bound for the number of key-value pairs
stored in the object C<obj>. The argument will be a pointer C<type_of>
returned C<UJ_T_OBJ> for earlier. The return value must be E<gt>= the actual
number of key value pairs in the object. It'll be used to calculated
the C<len> argument to pass to a future call to C<alloc> when serializing
objects in I<deterministic> or I<pretty-printed> format (see L<uni-json-serializer(3)>).

=item * C(void end_object_traversal(void *oiter)>

Called by the serializer when it's done with serializing an object. The argument will be
a pointer returned by an earlier C<start_object_traversal> call.

=item * C<int next_kv_pair(void *oiter, struct uj_kv_pair *kvp)>

Called to determine information about the next key-value pair from some object
identified by the object iterator C<oiter>. The value will be a pointer returned
by an earlier C<start_object_traversal> call. Should return 0 if all key-value
pairs for this object were already returned, otherwise 1 and set C<kvp> suitably.
C<< kvp->key.s >> must be an UTF8-string representing the key text, C<< kvp->key.len >>
the length of this string. The pointer C<< kvp->val >> must point to the corresponding
value. All key and value pointers returned by calls to C<next_kv_pair> for a certain
C<oiter> must remain valid until C<end_object_traversal> has been called for the
same C<oiter> pointer.

The function won't be called again with a specific C<oiter> argument after it
returned 0 for it once.
